## Freelance Contract Samples

These are a series of contract samples, including both full contracts and some drop-in clauses

### Reminder

A good, enforceable contract is a necessary part of any freelancer's toolkit. It is not, and never will be, the **only** piece, and may not always be the most imporant piece either.

See, for example, [this informative article](http://the-toast.net/2015/07/09/want-to-be-a-freelancer/).

###DISCLAIMER

None of this is legal advice. I am not your lawyer, and nothing in these samples or accompanying documents is intended to create any sort of attorney-client relationship. These are meant as illustrations of what a freelancer's contract could look like, not as verbatim ready-to-go contracts for use.

Any contract you intend to use should first be reviewed by an attorney. State contract and employment laws can vary wildly in sometimes unexpected ways, and these samples cannot account for all use-cases or variations in state or local laws.
